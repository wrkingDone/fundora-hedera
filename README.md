## 🪙 Fundora – Hedera Integration Summary

### Hedera Token Service (HTS):
**We integrated HTS to handle all token-based crowdfunding transactions within Fundora**. Using HTS allows donations and fund transfers to be executed with fixed, predictable fees (as low as $0.0001 per transaction), making micro-contributions practical and affordable for African founders and supporters. **HTS ensures that each transaction is fast, secure, and transparent, eliminating intermediaries** while giving creators direct control of their funds. This predictability and efficiency are vital for Fundora’s goal of making fundraising accessible and sustainable across low-cost environments.

### Hedera Consensus Service (HCS):
**Fundora utilizes HCS for immutable logging of campaign activities and donation events**, ensuring every contribution, update, and milestone is recorded permanently on-chain. This creates a verifiable and tamper-proof history of campaign performance, promoting trust and transparency. **The low-cost, high-throughput nature of HCS makes it ideal for auditable records, giving donors confidence that their contributions are tracked and publicly visible** — a core value for building transparency in African crowdfunding.

## 🚀 **Overview**

**Fundora** is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the **Hedera Network**, designed to empower founders, innovators, and changemakers across Africa to access **transparent and trustless funding**.

In a world where traditional fundraising often excludes early-stage creators or lacks transparency, Fundora introduces a new model of crowdfunding — one that is **borderless**, **immutable**, **community-driven**, and **fair**.

✨ Using Hedera’s powerful infrastructure, Fundora ensures that:
- ✅ Every donation is instantly traceable on-chain.  
- ✅ Every creator maintains full control of their campaign.  
- ✅ Every supporter can verify where their contribution goes — all in **real time**.

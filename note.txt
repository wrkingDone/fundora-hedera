the hardhat version used in the tutorial is v2.13.0 so incase there is an error, you can always check the version and adjust

there is always an error whenever i deploy the project whereby the contract call fails - the troubleshoot involves me setting the connected wallet to the supposed wallet that the 'connect wallet' has connected to 

the process of deploying and starting the project - 
    - first start the hardhat node
    - then run the deploy script(make sure the network is set to hardhat node)
    - then start the app (npm run dev)
;

cmd to deploy to hardhat localhost 
`npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js`
